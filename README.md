# Will COVID survive this summer?

This project explore an approach to covid cases forecasting based on Graph Neural Networks and mobility data.

## Description

Since the very beginning of coronavirus pandemic, cases of new infection have been recorded at multiple geographical locations at regular intervals ([OWID](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data), [NYT](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), [JHU](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)). Can we train a Spatiotemporal GNN (as in [^1]) to predict evolution of coronavirus’ spread?
Also, the graph costruction problem is challenging in this setting.
